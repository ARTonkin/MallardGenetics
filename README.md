## MallardGenetics

See my website www.tonkinprojects.com for a more indepth description and some sample outputs.

I was hired as a statistical consultant for a researcher who was interested in the links between duck genetics and their biometrics (physical traits). This repository includes the partial code from this project. I have permission to use this data and code for personal projects.

### Part 1 July - November 2019


### Part 2 January - August 2020

In part 2, I had a new dataset, a single one that was combined and well cleaned.

Part 2 involved the creation of conditional decision trees. The endeavor was to create a tree which would split the genetic data as best as possible, thereby creating a decision tree in which you could use the biometric measurements of a duck to give a guess as to its genetics.

The trees were graphed with the ggparty library. I created a layout which shows the number of ducks at each split, as well as the proportion of each genetic type.
